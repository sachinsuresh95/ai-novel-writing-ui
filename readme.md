# ü§ñ AI Novel Writing UI

**AI Novel Writer** is a powerful, open-source application designed for creative writers who want to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in their novel-writing process. Inspired by tools like Sudowrite, this application provides a seamless interface to connect your own OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint, giving you full control over your AI writing assistant. Everything is saved in the browser, no servers.


## ‚ú® Features

- **‚úçÔ∏è Intuitive 3-Column Layout**: Keep your workspace organized with a clear view of your document outline, main editor, and AI generation history.
- **üîå Bring Your Own LLM**: Configure the app to use any OpenAPI-compatible API endpoint. This means you can use open-source models or your own fine-tuned models.
- **üß† Core AI Writing Tools**:
  - **Write**: Let the AI continue writing from your cursor's position.
  - **Rewrite**: Get alternative phrasing for your selected text.
  - **Describe**: Elaborate on a selected word or phrase with rich, sensory details.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Generation History**: All AI outputs are saved as cards. Easily review and insert the best generations into your manuscript.
- **üíæ Persistent Settings**: Your LLM endpoint and API key are saved securely in your browser's local storage.
- **üì± Modern & Responsive UI**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the dark-themed interface is clean, modern, and works beautifully on all screen sizes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sachinsuresh95/novel-writer-ui.git
    cd novel-writer-ui
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Run the following command to start the Vite development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser**:
    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar address shown in your terminal).

## usage

### 1. Configure Your AI Settings

When you first open the application, a settings modal will appear.

- **LLM Endpoint URL**: Enter the full URL of your OpenAI-compatible completions endpoint.
- **API Key (Optional)**: If your endpoint requires an authentication token, enter it here. It will be sent as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

Click **Save**. Your settings will be stored locally in your browser for future sessions.

#### Example: Setting up with a Local LLM

You can use a tool like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to serve an LLM locally. Here‚Äôs an example of how to configure it with LM Studio:

1.  Download and install LM Studio.
2.  In LM Studio, go to the **Local Server** tab.
3.  Select a model and click **Start Server**.
4.  Copy the server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`).
5.  In AI Novel Writer, paste this URL into the **LLM Endpoint URL** field.
6.  You can leave the API key field empty if your local server doesn't require one.

### 2. Start Writing

Use the central editor to write your novel. Your text is automatically saved to your browser's local storage as you type, so you won't lose your work.

### 3. Use the AI Tools

- **To Write**: Place your cursor where you want the AI to continue and click the **Write** button in the AI Toolbar.
- **To Rewrite or Describe**: First, select a piece of text in the editor. Then, click the corresponding button in the AI Toolbar.

### 4. Use AI Generations

AI-generated text will appear as cards in the right-hand panel.

- Click the **Insert** button on any card to add its content to your manuscript at your last cursor position.
- If you have text selected in the editor, inserting a generation will replace the selected text.
